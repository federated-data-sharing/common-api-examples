# Common API - Worked examples

## Introduction

This repository contains some worked examples of how to use the Federated Data Sharing Common API, especially when developing analysis plans that require setting up containerised scripts.

The examples have been defined for the work in progress Version 1.1.0 of the Common API. 

- Please refer to the [Common API](https://github.com/federated-data-sharing/common-api) for details of the API itself.
- The [User Guide](https://github.com/federated-data-sharing/common-api/blob/master/doc/User_Guide.md) provides background information on how to use the examples
